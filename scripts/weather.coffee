# Description:
#   Example scripts for you to examine and try out.
#
# Notes:
#   They are commented out by default, because most of them are pretty silly and
#   wouldn't be useful and amusing enough for day to day huboting.
#   Uncomment the ones you want to try and experiment with.
#
#   These are from the scripting documentation: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md

module.exports = (robot) ->

#   robot.hear /weather/i, (mes) ->
#        get_weather mes
#
#get_weather = (msg) ->
#    msg.http('http://wttr.in')
#    .get() (err, res, body) ->
#         msg.send "#{body}"
